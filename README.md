The following repository comprises a set of scripts written in Julia 1.9.3 to numerically resolve the 1D and 2D advection PDE using finite volume methods. Also includes two folders storing GIF examples of the results.

This project was developed as final project for the subject "Finite Volume Methods" from the Advanced Physics and Applied Mathematics Master's Degree at the University of the Balearic Islands.

Warning: These scripts were also written as a way to learn and get in touch with the language. Therefore, I am confident there is still room for improvement and optimisation. In the foreseeable future I will try to write a cleaner and better version of the scripts.
